# subscriptionstracker
 App that calculates a set of monthly subscriptions and returns the next renewal based on the day of the month and the amount paid
 
 
 Purpose of this app is to help an organization to keep track of all its monthly subscriptions. This application is intended to be used from organization's subscriptions managers, who must signal to my app when a subscription has been paid. My app returns the next deadline for subscription. This can help huge organizations keep track of all incoming credits.
